# wordle-vocab
The current wordle vocabulary for important wordle research projects. 

There is a vocab object which appears to contain the list of available words for each day. 
The "other" object is also in the source code as an additional alphabetical list but it's not clear what function this list has - please let me know if you find out. 

If you create a fun wordle project let me know so I can add it to the repo.
